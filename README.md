A small plugin to facilitate LaTeX input.


# Features
## <Tab> key 
	* Cleans up any extraneous braces at the cursor
	* Jumps to the next useful location
	* Ultisnips integration

## Shortcut characters 
	* In insert mode, pressing ";f" will expand to \frac{a}{}, with
	  the cursor placed at a. Then entering numbers is just two tab
	  stops away.


## More to come.
